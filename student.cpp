/*
Design a C++ application to collect, validate, and display academic details for multiple students.
For each student, the user must input their first name, last name, class, roll number, and marks.
The system should validate all inputs (ensuring correct types and meaningful values), calculate
the student’s grade based on their marks, and then display each student’s complete information.
The system must support multiple students using a fixed-size array.
